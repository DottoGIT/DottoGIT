I'm a student at Politechnika Warszawska, with a passion for developing projects and expanding my skill set. I've worked on various projects, some of which are showcased below. I'm currently seeking job opportunities where I can grow and contribute. I'm a fast learner, highly motivated, and eager to build my career within a dynamic company.

## Games I've Created
One of my main hobbies is developing games from scratch. While many projects have remained unfinished and the code quality may not always be top-notch, these projects represent a significant part of my life that I enjoy sharing. Projects are listed from the most recent to the oldest, everyone of them was created in Unity using **C#** language
